### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/campust.git
   cd campust/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each application:
   ```bash
   cd user-app
   npm install
   # Repeat for other frontend applications
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create `.env` file in each application directory
   - Set API endpoints, authentication keys, and other configuration

4. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to services directory:
   ```bash
   cd campust/services
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each service:
   ```bash
   cd user-service
   npm install
   # Repeat for other services
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create `.env` file in each service directory
   - Set database connection, JWT secrets, and other configuration

4. Initialize database:
   - Run migration scripts provided in each service's `/migrations` folder
   - Seed initial data if needed

5. Start services:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # Or using Docker Compose
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Judge0 and Code Server Setup

1. Configure Judge0:
   ```bash
   cd services/judge0-master
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Configure Code Server:
